<h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>

<p>
The history of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly spans over 281 years.
The first church was established in 1745 and was later rebuilt multiple times
due to severe sea erosion.
</p>

<p>
The present church, modeled after St. Paul’s Basilica in Rome,
was solemnly blessed on 22 November 1942 and is now revered under the
patronage of St. Antony.
